<p>It's been a while since I <a href="http://mbmccormick.com/2011/06/becoming-a-program-manager/" target="_blank">last updated</a>. As it stands today, I am heading into my sixth week here at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>. I have been busy working away during the week and making the most of my time in the Seattle area on weekends. I've met a lot of new people over the last few weeks, both fellow interns and people I work with on my team.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I got my first <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank">Windows Phone</a> on <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/index.html" target="_blank">Verizon</a>. I waited in line at the Microsft-only Verizon Store on the morning it came out and got a great price on the <a href="http://phones.verizonwireless.com/htc/trophy/" target="_blank">device</a>. Unlike <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5598897/ballmer-yes-interns-you-get-free-windows-phone-7-phones-too" target="_blank">last year's interns</a>, my device was not free, but I did get to upgrade early and paid next to nothing for it. It's a great phone and, my employer aside, it's a great operating system. I honestly think that if more consumers went and used a Windows Phone 7 device, they would fall in love with it.</p>

<p>Last week my girlfriend, <a href="http://elizabethpuccinelli.com/" target="_blank" data-proofer-ignore>Libby</a>, came to visit me! She flew out on Tuesday night and stayed until Sunday morning. I had to work on Wednesday and Thursday, but my manager let me have Friday off since I had to work on the Memorial Day holiday. We spent a lot of time in downtown Seattle, at <a href="http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/" target="_blank">Pike Place Market</a>, visited the <a href="http://www.spaceneedle.com/" target="_blank">Space Needle</a>, and went to a <a href="http://www.soundersfc.com/" target="_blank">Seattle Sounders</a> game. We also visited <a href="https://foursquare.com/venue/152205" target="_blank">Microsoft City Center</a> in downtown Bellevue, which has a <a href="https://twitter.com/mbmccormick/status/76826041682903040" target="_blank">gorgeous 26th floor patio</a>. On Thursday night we ate at <a href="http://www.canlis.com/" target="_blank">Canlis</a>, a <a href="http://www.canlis.com/place/" target="_blank">beautiful</a> restaurant in Seattle that overlooks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Union" target="_blank" data-proofer-ignore>Lake Union</a>. It was one of the <a href="http://www.zagat.com/r/canlis-seattle" target="_blank">best meals</a> that I've ever had. We also visited <a href="http://www.snoqualmiefalls.com/" target="_blank">Snoqualmie Falls</a>, about a 30 minute drive from Redmond. Because of all the runoff from the late snow and early rains, the waterfall is <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g58748-d141315-r16389521-Snoqualmie_Falls-Snoqualmie_Washington.html#UR16389521" target="_blank">particularly active this year</a>. I had a great time with her here, but I'm looking forward to seeing her again when I head home for Connor's graduation party in mid-July.</p>

<p>Lately, I've been using the <a href="http://proclub.com/" target="_blank">Pro Sports Club</a> almost every night. Some friends and I meet up to play racquetball and I usually swim afterwards. On Friday last week we had a team morale event, Office Goes to the Movies. I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1133985/" target="_blank">Green Lantern in 3D</a> on Friday morning. It was great to take a break from work and get to know my team a little better. On Friday night I went to a party at my <a href="https://foursquare.com/venue/387297" target="_blank">friend's apartment</a> in Bellevue. They had a beautiful patio on the roof of their apartment complex, so we had a barbecue and watched the sunset with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier" target="_blank" data-proofer-ignore>Mount Rainier</a> in the distance.</p>

<p>This week I have my first Core Design Review on Monday, where I will be meeting with my team, my customers, and the stakeholders for my feature to present my proposed design. I have already met with most of these attendees to get feedback, so hopefully tomorrow will just be a review for everyone and I can just get everyone together to sign off on things. On Tuesday, I have my <a href="http://careers.microsoft.com/careers/en/us/internprogram.aspx" target="_blank">Checkpoint Review</a> with my manager. This is the halfway point for my internship, where my manager and I will discuss my progress thus far and review the commitments that I made at the beginning of the summer to ensure that I am on track. At the end of the meeting, my manager will make a decision of whether or not I am "performing at a level that would indicate future success in a professional position" or if I need to make some improvements.</p>

<p>Hopefully this week will go as planned, I'm sure it will. Next weekend my friends and I are going to the Seattle Sounders game, along with a group of other interns, thanks to Microsoft. Then next week, my family is in town for a week to celebrate my mom's birthday, the Fourth of July, and my 21st birthday. I am really looking forward to seeing my family in the next couple of weeks!</p>
