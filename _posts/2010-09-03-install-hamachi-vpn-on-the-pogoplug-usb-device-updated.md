<p><em>Update: Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="http://stevejobsisadouche.com/">George Lerdsuwanrut</a> for all of his help with this guide, the instructions below should now work with the latest PogoPlug Firmware. (10/15/2010)</em></p>

<p>Just over a month ago, I wrote a <a href="http://mbmccormick.com/2010/07/install-hamachi-vpn-on-the-pogoplug-usb-device/" target="_blank">post</a> about how to install Hamachi on the PogoPlug USB device, effectively bringing your hard drives and (eventually printers) to the Hamachi network. I&rsquo;ve recently moved all of the source code for this <a href="http://github.com/mbmccormick/hamachi-pogoplug" target="_blank">project</a> over to <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> where you can download the source, contribute, or fork the project.</p>

<p>I repackaged all of the necessary installation files and included a helpful readme file for installation. You can find the updated installation procedure below. First, you need to enable write access to the device:</p>

<p>Next, you will need to download the packaged source code from GitHub and extract it:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1273099.js"> </script>


<p>Next, copy the included files to their respective directories:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1273100.js"> </script>


<p>Next we need to link some of the libraries together and modify permissions:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1273102.js"> </script>


<p>Next, we need to modify our path variables to point to the Hamachi binaries.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1273103.js"> </script>


<p>Now we need to prepare our VPN drivers and start Hamachi:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1273105.js"> </script>


<p>Lastly, we need to set up our device to enable write access and start Hamachi on boot:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1273107.js"> </script>


<p>You should now be able to access the Hamachi network using the legacy Linux commands. The Hamachi service should also be set to run when the device boots.</p>
