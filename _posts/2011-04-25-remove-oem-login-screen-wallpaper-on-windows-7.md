<p>If you follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/mbmccormick" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, then I'm sure you're aware of my current <a href="http://twitter.com/mbmccormick/status/58600614942355456" target="_blank">computer difficulties</a>. Long story short, Dell sent someone out to replace my motherboard and hard drive and now I'm left with a fresh copy of Windows 7 that I need to restore to my working standards. One of those standards is removing the Dell wallpaper from the Windows 7 login screen. To do that, you just need to modify the following registry entry. Just change this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)" target="_blank" data-proofer-ignore>DWORD</a> value from <code>1</code> to <code>0</code>.</p>
