title: "Milkman: Remember The Milk for Windows Phone"
---

Over the past week or so I have been working on my latest application for [Windows Phone](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/default.aspx). It's a simple task manager application that syncs with [Remember The Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com), called Milkman. Milkman is a beautiful, clean interface for your Remember The Milk tasks that seamlessly integrates with the Windows Phone experience. 

Milkman isn't the first Remember The Milk client for Windows Phone, [WinMilk](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/apps/2571dafd-7ee7-df11-a844-00237de2db9e) was the first application of it's kind to hit the Marketplace and currently holds a lot of the market share. However, WinMilk hasn't seen a lot of love lately and I didn't really like the interface, so I decided to write my own client and I am really happy with how it turned out. Take a look at the screenshots below for a quick overview:

You can also watch a quick video demo of [Milkman on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zmR9IgxgDA).

Milkman also takes advantage of some of the more advanced features of Windows Phone "Mango" like background tasks, live tiles, launchers, and calendar reminders. Take a look at the list of features below:

*  Complete integration with Metro styling
*  Creative use of typograhy and list controls to display task information
*  Background task syncing
*  Live tile counter of tasks due today
*  Popup reminders for tasks one hour before due time
*  Location-based task reminders
*  Advanced diagnostics and error reports

You can [download Milkman](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/apps/2d14a2ea-9445-4d46-b385-8b2e45f7f6d8) in the Windows Phone Marketplace today for free. I would have liked to charge for this application because it has a lot of "premium" features that other Remember The Milk clients don't have, but unfortunately Remember The Milk does not allow commercial use of their API.
