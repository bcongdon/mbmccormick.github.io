title: 'Reading Phone Numbers, Access Codes with Twilio\'s Speech Engine'
---

Here's a quick tip on how to get [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com) to read a phone number, access code, or how to spell out a word to users with the Twilio [speech engine](http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/2010-04-01/twiml/say). The Python function below will take in any string, split the string into multiple characters, and then add a space and comma between each character. The result is that Twilio will say each letter or number separately at a slower speed.

Without separating the characters, Twilio's speech engine understands "ABC123" as a word and attempts to read it. But when you send "A, B, C, 1, 2, 3," in your TwiML, Twilio will read this naturally, at a speed slow enough that the caller can write it down. This is useful when reading phone numbers or access codes, depending on your service. This is a little tricky in Python, so I thought I'd share this.
