**Send To Reader** makes it easy to send any website from your Windows Phone to your Kindle. Simply tap and hold on any website or news article and Share it to the Send To Reader app. Enter your Kindle's email address and the website will be converted to a Kindle-friendly e-ink format for better readability. A few seconds later, the website will appear on your Kindle! Why strain your eyes reading a long article on your phone's screen when you can read it on your Kindle instead?
