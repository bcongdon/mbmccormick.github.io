This is a [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)-powered blog hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for [mbmccormick.com](http://mbmccormick.com). Feel free to browse the source, fork this repository, or [ask me questions](http://twitter.com/mbmccormick). You can read about my transition from WordPress to Jekyll [here](http://mbmccormick.com/2011/10/ditching-wordpress-for-jekyll-and-github/).

## Website Design

Credit for the original design and inspiration of this website goes to [Erik Eng](http://erikeng.se/). While many of his design elements are still in use in my website's current design, I have made the following changes to his code:

* Translated to english
* Cleaned up the HTML code and stripped out most of the social integration
* Modified some of the styles and layouts
* Eliminated the need to compile client-side before deploying
* Added support for Disqus comments
* Added support for LinkedIn link in the About include
* Website is now W3C valid and follows all HTML5 standards

I've also added some more GitHub-style colors and icons to the design. The website itself is built server-side by GitHub Pages and uses Travis CI to do some additional validation and checks for broken links.
