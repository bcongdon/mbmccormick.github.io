My name is Matt McCormick and I'm a Program Manager at Microsoft and a Computer Science graduate from Purdue University. During the day, I'm a Product Owner for the Skype team. At night, I'm a hacker, chef, gardener, dog lover, beer and wine connoisseur, and a bunch of other things. I'm married to a beautiful woman and we live together in Seattle with our crazy dog. She writes about our life <a href="http://libbyandmatt.com" target="_blank">here</a>. I often tweet about my adventures on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/mbmccormick" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and I occasionally write nerdy things on this blog.

You can take a look at my open source projects on <a href="https://www.github.com/mbmccormick" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. If you see something you like, enjoyed one of my blog posts, or use one of my applications, share the love and <a href="/donate">buy me a beer</a> on PayPal!
