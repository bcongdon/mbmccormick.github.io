### My name is Matt McCormick.

I'm a Program Manager at Microsoft and a Computer Science graduate from Purdue University. I'm currently working on the Office 365 service fabric at Microsoft, building automation that manages hardware maintenance and paving the way for intelligent datacenters that run themselves. I'm a Midwest transplant living in Seattle with my wife and our dog.
