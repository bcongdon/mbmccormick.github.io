My name is Matt McCormick and I am a Program Manager at Microsoft and a Computer Science graduate from <a href="http://www.purdue.edu" target="_blank">Purdue University</a>. During the day, I am a Product Owner for the Skype team. At night, I am a hacker/chef/gardener/dog-lover/beer-connoisseur in Seattle. I often tweet about my adventures on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/mbmccormick" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and I occasionally write nerdy things on my blog.

You can take a look at my source projects on <a href="https://www.github.com/mbmccormick" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. If you see something you like, enjoyed one of my blog posts, or use one of my applications, share the love and <a href="/donate">buy me a beer</a> on PayPal!
